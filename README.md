# -StopTheSpread

This is my app for the class CS590u. It basically allows you to search high risk places in this time of quarantine. It also allows you to upload data about where you have been if you do have coronavirus, so as to better inform others.

MainActivity: Entering screen, query for email and whether you have coronavirus or not
CoronaActivity: Asks you to upload places you have been and times if you claim you do have it
NoCoronaActivity: Asks you to upload places you want to go today to assess the risk of going there
